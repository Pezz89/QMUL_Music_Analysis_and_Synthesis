\section{Task Solution}
\subsection{Feature extraction}
Used RMS, F0 and spectral flux, see figure~\ref{} for illustration of loop
selection based on these features.
Spectral flux used for salience of spectral content was calculated as:
$$ Insert math here...$$.
RMS used as a simple loudness measurement and was calculated as:
$$ Insert maths here $$.
An implementation of the YIN algorithm was adapted for fundamental frequency
estimation. Parabolic interpolation was also added for increased accuracy.
It was noticed that as the system would only be analysing audio of specific,
relatively static pitches, it was not necessary to differentiate between
different octaves. For this reason, the F0 was wrapped and centred using the
chroma spectrum. This allowed for the negation of octave errors commonly seen
in auto-correlation based F0 estimation algorithms:
$$ Insert math here...$$
This significantly improved the measurement of pitch spread as discussed in
the following section.

\subsection{Feature analysis/loop selection}
A moving standard deviation was then taken for each of the three features,
creating 3 vectors to measure the spread of these features over time.
An iteratively increasing threshold was applied to the standard deviation
measurements, searching for segments of consecutive frames to be used for
looping. A frame was considered viable if it's length was greater than it's
mean fundamental period multiplied by the minimum number of periods set as a
parameter. 
Upon finding a suitable frame, positive zero crossings are searched for around
it's starting index and the closest multiple to the mean f0 period at the end
point. These values form the final start and end indexes for the loop.

\subsection{Synthesis}
Output is then synthesized by segmenting the audio into three sections (start,
loop and end) and inserting an integer number of loops in place of
the loop segment found. The number of loops inserted is calculated based on the
duration provided in samples, and the closest number of loops to the desired
overall length of the sample is used.
Initially a method using overlap-add with crossfading was tested, however, this
was not used because amplitude modulation detracted from overall quality


\section{Evaluation}
minimum period proved to be the primary parameter used for tuning the system.
Low values resulted in the selection of smaller loops, with less variation in
content over time. Too small and the loop would sound synthetic without
variation. High values resulted in larger loops with more variation. Hiigher
variation clearly sounded more natural but increased the chance of
dicontinuities due to sudden changes at loop points. careful splicing of
samples at zero crossings made sure there were no clicks at loop points (see
figure~\ref{} for illustartion of segmentation at zero crossings) but
long samples will evolve over time, thus inheriantly not looping well.
a reasonable value of 25 periods was found to provide a good trade off between
these two charachteristics.
A range of audio files were tested using the system. Each was stretched by a
duration of 1.5 time it's origonal duration. This was the only duration tested
significantly as the system is not designed to handle anything less than the
original duration of the sample and further duration would simply add more
loops.
vibrato a key problem with cello. multiples of the vobrato's period as well as
the frequency would need to be selected for better handeling on this. 
Vocal vibrato performed possibly the worst. This was entirely expected as
statically looping audio with such temporal variation will resulted in clearly
unatural results.
Instruments with the least variation such as the trumpet and tombone appeared
to perform best, with only minor variations in amplitude missing from the
looped section.

\subsection{Possible improvements}
searching for start/end of periods
output duration isn't sample accurate
Gradient ascent could be applied for accurate and more efficient calculation
of thresholds for audio segmentation.
