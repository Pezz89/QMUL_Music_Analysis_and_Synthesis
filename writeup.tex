\section{Task Solution}
The approach to this task consisted of the extraction of relevant features from
the audio, the estimation of stable sections from these features, the
refinement of segment boundaries and finally, the synthesis of the output audio
based on the best segment found.

\subsection{Feature extraction}
Three features were chosen to provide as measure for the overall stability of
the audio at any time in the audio. These features are fundamental frequency
($f_0$), Root Mean Square and Spectral Flux.\\
Spectral flux, used for measuring salience of spectral content, was calculated as:
$$
\text{SF}(n) =
\frac{\sqrt{\sum_{K/2-1}^{k=0}(|X(k,n)|-|X(k,n-1)|)^2}}{K/2}
$$
where $X$ represents the DFT of the audio, $K$ is the current DFT bin index, $K$ is
the total number of bins and $n$ is the current sample
index~\parencite{Lerch2012}.\\
RMS was chosen as a simple measure for loudness and was calculated as:
$$RMS(n) = \sqrt{\frac{1}{N}\sum_{i=i_s(n)}^{i_e(n)}{x(i)^2}}$$
where $i$ represents indexes in the current frame of audio and N is the total
number of indexes in the current frame~\parencite{Lerch2012}.

An implementation of the YIN algorithm was adapted for fundamental frequency
estimation~\parencite[p352-353]{Zolzer2011}. This implementation was further
modified to use parabolic interpolation for increased accuracy.
It was also noticed that as the system would only be analysing audio of
specific, relatively static pitches, it was not necessary to differentiate
between different octaves. For this reason, the $f_0$ was wrapped and centred
using the chroma spectrum~\parencite[p.4]{Peeters2006} This allowed for the negation of octave errors
commonly seen in auto-correlation based $f_0$ estimation algorithms. This was
achieved by first mapping estimated frequencies to the semi-tone pitch
spectrum:
$$n(f_k) = 12\log_2\Big(\frac{f_k}{440}\Big)+69$$
Pitches were then wrapped around a single octave and centred on the spectrum by
subtracting the median and adding half an octave:
$$c(n) = \bmod((n-\mu)+6, 12)$$
where $f_k$ is the current frequency estimate, $n$ is the current estimate
mapped to the semi-tone pitch spectrum and $\mu$ is the median of all $n$.
This significantly improved the measurement of pitch spread  as discussed in
the following section.

see figure~\ref{} for illustration of loop
selection based on these features.
\subsection{Feature analysis/loop selection}
Having extracted relevant features, analysis is then performed to determine the
stability of the audio.  A moving standard deviation is taken for each of the
three features, creating 3 vectors to measure the spread of these features over
time.  An iteratively increasing threshold is then applied to the standard
deviation measurements, searching for segments of consecutive frames to be used
for looping. A frame is considered viable if it's length was greater than it's
mean fundamental period multiplied by the minimum number of periods set as a
parameter. An example of segmentation based on standard deviation values is
illustrated in figure~\ref{}.\\
Upon finding a suitable frame, positive zero crossings are searched for around
it's starting index and the closest multiple to the mean $f_0$ period at the end
point. This was to implemented to account for inaccuracies in estimation of the
segment's pitch and to help ensure an integer number of periods were selected
for a segment. These values form the final start and end indexes for the loop.
Segmentation of audio based on zero-crossing is illustrated in figure~\ref{}

\subsection{Synthesis}
Output is then synthesized by segmenting the audio into three sections (start,
loop and end) and inserting an integer number of loops in place of
the loop segment found. The number of loops inserted is calculated based on the
duration provided in samples, and the closest number of loops to the desired
overall length of the sample is used.
Initially a method using overlap-add with crossfading was tested. However, this
was eventually discarded as it was decided that the amplitude modulation
created detracted significantly from the overall quality of output.

\section{Evaluation}
The system was evaluated by increasing the duration of a selection of single
note samples (original samples included in \texttt{./OriginalAudio}). It was
assumed for the purpose of evaluation, that the system would be used for
increasing single note durations of harmonic instruments for use in software
samplers, for example. It is likely that the system would not perform well on
polyphonic recordings of percussive instruments.\\
The minimum period allowed for a viable segment proved to be the primary
parameter used for tuning the system.  Low values resulted in the selection of
smaller loops, with less variation in content over time. Too small, and the
loop would sound synthetic without variation. High values resulted in larger
loops with more variation. Higher variation clearly sounded more natural but
increased the chance of discontinuities due to sudden changes at loop points.
Careful splicing of samples at zero crossings ensured smooth transitions at
loop points.  However, long samples will evolve over time, thus inherently not
looping well due to the lack of continuity between the segment's start and
finish.  A reasonable value of 25 periods was found to provide a good trade off
between these two characteristics.\\
A range of audio files were tested using the system. Each was stretched by a
duration of 1.5 time it's original duration. This was the only duration tested
significantly as the system is not designed to handle anything less than the
original duration of the sample and further durations would simply add more
loops.\\
Instruments with the least variation in amplitude and spectral content over
time (such as the trumpet and trombone) appeared to perform best, with only
minor variations in amplitude noticeably missing from the looped section.
Across the range of samples, it was clear that vibrato posed a key problem
with this style of synthesis. This was particularly clear in the cello results,
as looped segments did not preserve the oscillations of the vibrato, creating a
clearly synthetic loop. This would need to be addressed, possibly by segmenting
based on multiples of the vibrato's period in addition to the frequency.\\
Vocal vibrato performed possibly the worst of all samples. This was entirely
expected as statically looping audio with such temporal variation will resulted
in clearly natural results.\\
Other instruments that have clear decays, such as the piano and guitar, were
synthesized to a reasonable degree with correct selection of the minimum
period. The most noticeable effect was in the sudden sustain of the note. This
is obviously not possible with these types of instruments and so these are
perhaps less useful examples for demonstration of this system.

\subsection{Possible improvements}
searching for start/end of periods
output duration isn't sample accurate
Gradient ascent could be applied for accurate and more efficient calculation
of thresholds for audio segmentation.
